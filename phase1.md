# Phase I – Foundations

This phase covered the basics of programming and data science in bioinformatics using Python and Colab notebooks. I provide resources on environment setup with a bias to Colab as it is easier to access and navigate. I also provided introductory resources to Python, Bash, and other mentioned concepts.
