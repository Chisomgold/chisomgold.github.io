# Final Projects

Students worked on independent projects for both tracks. The data science project used a variant file from Zenodo as the data of interest for analyses, with instructions for 
provided in the notebook and the accompanying video. The main feedback points provided were on overcommenting individual code cells; redefining the same function over and over, which 
defeats the purpose of a function; and ensuring that cell comments match the code and the outputs.

For the programming project, participants were asked to convert a variant calling Bash script into a Python script that does the same job or performs better. The main feedback 
provided for this task was on ensuring that documentation of any code/script has clear instructions for any interested individual to implement, to avoid a case of "it worked on
my PC, so I don't know what's wrong with yours".
