# A Mini-Course on Bioinformatics

This site hosts materials for an 8-week intro to bioinformatics course focused on 2 tracks: data science and programming. It was curated as part of an internship program for an organisation called CAT2D. You can find them on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/computer-aided-therapeutic-discovery-and-design-group/about/). The program was partially guided (that is, with assistance to participants), but I designed its content to be relatively self-paced.

- 📅 Duration: 8 weeks (split into 3 phases, with phase 1 shared by the tracks)  
- 🎥 Format: YouTube videos, slides, Google Colab notebooks  
- 🧠 Skills: Data analysis and scripting with Python and Bash
- 👩🏽‍🤝‍👩🏼 Audience: Beginners in bioinformatics, regardless of academic background. However, some knowledge of biology would aid understanding of the data and resulting outputs.
